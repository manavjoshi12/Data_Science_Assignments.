    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It provides a way to manage, store, and retrieve information efficiently. There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on a relational model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. SQL databases use SQL, a standard language for managing data in relational databases, to create, read, update, and delete data. SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex querying and strong data consistency, such as financial applications or enterprise resource planning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, do not use a fixed schema like SQL databases, and do not rely on SQL as the primary language for managing data. Instead, they use a variety of data models such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph. NoSQL databases are best suited for applications that require high scalability and availability, such as social networks or gaming applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use various data models.\n",
    "2. Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema.\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more scalable than SQL databases.\n",
    "4. Consistency: SQL databases provide strong data consistency, while NoSQL databases provide weaker consistency.\n",
    "5. Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application. SQL databases are generally preferred for applications that require strong consistency and complex querying, while NoSQL databases are preferred for applications that require high scalability and availability."

It is used to establish a relationship between two tables by ensuring that the data in the foreign key column matches the data in the primary key column of the other table.
