    "* Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It is a simple measure of dispersion but can be misleading if there are extreme values or outliers in the dataset. For example, if we have the following dataset of daily high temperatures for a city: [25, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36], the range would be 11 (36-25).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variance: Variance measures how far the values in a dataset are from the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data points are more spread out. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean. For example, if we have the following dataset of ages for a group of people: [25, 27, 28, 30, 32], the mean would be 28.4. The variance would be calculated as: ((25-28.4)^2 + (27-28.4)^2 + (28-28.4)^2 + (30-28.4)^2 + (32-28.4)^2)/5 = 7.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a more commonly used measure of dispersion as it is in the same unit as the data. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out. For example, if we have the same dataset of ages as before, the standard deviation would be the square root of the variance: sqrt(7.04) = 2.65.\n",
